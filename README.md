PGA Project is a Python project leveraging web scraping and K-Means clustering to analyze and categorize golf statistics, subsequently providing insights into playing styles on the PGA Tour.

# Description

PGA Tour Analytics is a comprehensive Python project designed to unravel the nuances of professional golf by scrutinizing player statistics from the PGA Tour. The project explores the age-old adage 'Drive for show, putt for dough' by employing web scraping techniques to gather in-depth performance metrics. Through a meticulous data cleaning process, the project then utilizes K-Means clustering to categorize players based on their playing styles, investigating whether specific attributes, such as driving distance or putting proficiency, significantly impact a player's overall scoring performance. By delving into the world of golf analytics, this project seeks to uncover patterns and insights that contribute to the ongoing debate about the relative importance of different aspects of the game in determining success on the PGA Tour.

# Data

The project sources its data directly from the official PGA Tour website, leveraging web scraping techniques to extract detailed statistics and performance metrics of professional golfers. By tapping into the wealth of information provided by the PGA Tour, the project ensures the authenticity and accuracy of the dataset, offering a comprehensive view of player performance across various facets of the game. This robust dataset serves as the foundation for the subsequent data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis stages, enabling a thorough exploration of the factors influencing player success on the golf course.
